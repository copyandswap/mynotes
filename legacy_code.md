# legacy code

> **What's Legacy Code**

Legacy code is source code inherited from someone else or inherited from an older version of the software. It can also be any code that you don't understand that's difficult to change.

> **Why is Legacy Code a Challenge?**

The biggest challenge with working with older or unfamiliar code maybe your assumptions about it.

You may think the code is bad. Whoever wrote it didn't know what they were doing. You could have done a better job.

But the truth is, there's usually is a reason why the code is how it is. And if you didn't write it, you might not know that reason.

> **Tips for Working With Legacy Code**

1. **Test the Code**
   * One way to understand the code is to create characterization tests and unit tests. You can also run a static analyzer over your code to identify potential problems.
   * This will help you understand what the code actually does.
   * Once you understand the code, you can make changes with greater confidence.
2. **Review Documentation**
   * It will help you understand where the code came from.
3. **Only Rewrite Code When It's Necessary**
   * Rewriting and inherited codebase can be tempting. But it's usually a mistake.
   * It takes too much time and too many programmers to rewrite everything. And even if you do it, rewriting code can introduce new bugs. Or it can remove hidden functionality.
4. **Try Refactoring Instead**
   * It's better to try refactoring legacy rather than rewrite it.
   * Refactoring is the process of changing the structure of the code - without changing its functionality.
   * This cleans the code and makes it easier to understand.
5. **Don't Make Too Many Changes**
   * Don't make too many changes at once. 
6. **Collaborate With Other Developers**
   * You may not know the codebase very well. But some of your fellow developers probably do.
   * It's much faster to ask questions from those who know the codebase best.
7. **Keep New Code Clean**
   * You can make sure that the code you add is clean.
8. **Do Further Research**
   * Working with an inherited codebase gets easier with time. A junior developer may not understand why a codebase hasn't been refactored. But a senior developer will know when to leave it alone.
